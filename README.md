# The Galaxy Programming Language

Author: Nicholas E. Manley
License: ISC

## About

Galaxy is just a simple hobby project to help me learn about compilers.
It's not intended for real world use, and it is unlikely to be well
maintained after a certain point. It is not recommended that it be
used for a project of any importance.

## Status

Galaxy is in the very early stages of development. Currently, it cannot
compile any code. The lexer and parser are still being developed.

## Development

Galaxy uses LLVM 3.4.2 as the backend and has identical
dependencies. See the [LLVM Requirements](http://llvm.org/releases/3.4.2/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements)
for information on what dependencies are required to build Galaxy.
